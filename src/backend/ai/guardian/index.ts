/**
 * @fileoverview core-guardian — the entry point for ALL inference in this Worker.
 *
 * There is no local model, no Workers AI binding and no provider SDK here: the
 * `CORE_GUARDIAN` service binding is the only door, and this folder is the only
 * code that opens it. See `~/AGENTS-ai.md`.
 *
 * The modules behind this barrel:
 *
 * | File         | Owns                                                      |
 * |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `config.ts`  | **Every payload sent to the router**, and the project name |
 * | `types.ts`   | The wire contract, with no behaviour attached               |
 * | `errors.ts`  | `GuardianError` (router declined) vs `GuardianConfigError`  |
 * | `rpc.ts`     | The single typed cast of the `CORE_GUARDIAN` binding        |
 * | `chat.ts`    | `guardianChat` — one settled completion                     |
 * | `stream.ts`  | `guardianStream`; `stream-read.ts` parses its SSE body      |
 * | `title.ts`   | `guardianTitle` — the thread-title prompt                   |
 * | `followups.ts` | `guardianFollowups` — the suggested-next-prompt prompt    |
 *
 * Import from here (`@/backend/ai/guardian`), not from the files inside; the
 * split is free to change as long as this surface does not.
 *
 * @example
 * import { guardianChat, GUARDIAN_TASKS } from "@/backend/ai/guardian";
 *
 * const { text, model } = await guardianChat(env, {
 *   task: GUARDIAN_TASKS.chatReply,
 *   messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
 * });
